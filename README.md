# crab-social
Yes,It is just a IM app, and i will keep codding on it.

#### Why crab ?  
Cause I have a domain : xioix.vip (NOT work), see , it's like a crab, lol...

#### Let's tell a story:  
I always wants to have a IM app, before this one, I have already modify another one(Mock-wechat),  
but it's really a bad project, though it has receive more than 2000 star on github,  
I have cried for sever time during my secendary development time,  
so, I just want to develop my own app,  
that's why this project here.

#### What is used for?
Hmmmm... I have no ideal,but right now,I'll develop it in this case:
net-star(some people famous on internet)  
this app can used to contact with their fans

so the app will contain these module:  
- Chat with fans (Group fans:VIP | NON_VIP )
- Sell sth to fans
- Post TimeLine
- Leadding fans to play a mobie game?
